Superset of Javascript 
Features: 
    Static typing
    Code Completion
    Refactoring
    Shorthand notations
Drawbacks:
    Compilation (convert it to javascript)
    Discipline in coding 
    medium to large projects

Types: 
Number String Boolean Null Undefined Void Object Array Tuples "Any" Never unknown never

Syntax: 
let variableName: type = value

primitive types : string, number, and boolean 

Type inference: If assigning value at time of intiailising then no need to specify the data type

Don't use "Any" type , very bad practice
